# Restrict OneDrive access by security group

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

You can restrict access and sharing of OneDrive content to users in specified Microsoft Entra ID security groups. Even if other users outside of these security groups are licensed for OneDrive, they wonâ€™t have access to their own OneDrive or any shared OneDrive content when this policy is in effect. OneDrive access restriction at tenant level is applied when a user attempts to open a OneDrive or a file. 

You can use this to prevent new users from accessing any OneDrive content. For example, you can restrict OneDrive access and sharing to your new users, guest or frontline users. 

Note that users who are not members of the specified security group can still see files in organization-wide search and Copilot experiences if they have existing permissions to the file prior to the policy configuration. However they will not be able to open the file or OneDrive if they are not part of the specified security group. 

Note - If you want to prevent oversharing of OneDrive content also for users with existing permissions, we recommend you to enforce OneDrive site access restriction to an individual user's OneDrive. For more information, see [Restrict access to a user's OneDrive content to people in a security group](onedrive-site-access-restriction.md).
