# Get started with SharePoint agents

[SharePoint agents](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-agents-in-sharepoint-69e2faf9-2c1e-4baa-8305-23e625021bcf), powered by AI, help users quickly find information and insights on SharePoint sites, pages, and document libraries. These agents access your organization's data the same way [Copilot in other Microsoft 365 apps](/sharepoint/sharepoint-copilot-best-practices#copilot-and-sharepoint) does, responding to users based on their access permissions to the data. This article discusses how admins can get started with SharePoint agents, including setting up pay-as-you-go billing and managing Azure resources for agents.

## Understand who can set up and use agents

| **Action**          | **Requirements for the user**                                                                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Set up an agent** | - Assigned with a Copilot license or your organization has the pay-as-you-go billing set up<br>- Ability to add new files to a SharePoint site    |
| **Use an agent**    | - Assigned with a Copilot license or your organization has the pay-as-you-go billing set up                                                       |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization hasn’t adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, it’s recommended to review the requirements and learn how to adopt it for your organization. [Learn more](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview).  

## Use agents with Copilot licenses

Users can use SharePoint agents after being [assigned a Copilot license](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-enable-users#assign-licenses). You can use the [Microsoft 365 Copilot setup guide](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?Q=learndocs#/modernonboarding/microsoft365copilotsetupguide) in the Microsoft 365 admin center to assign the required licenses to users. For more information, see [Assign licenses to users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot requirements](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements). See more about [controlling user access through licensing](/sharepoint/manage-access-agents-in-sharepoint#control-user-access-through-licensing).

## Use agents with pay-as-you-go billing

For users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license to use SharePoint agents, you can set up pay-as-you-go billing for SharePoint agents. Once set up, the pay-as-you-go billing is used whenever a user without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license uses a SharePoint agent.
